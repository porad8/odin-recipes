        </em></ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
                pre-heat the oven's broiler.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Melt 1 and a half tablespoons butter in a sauce pan over
                medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until slightly brown,
                about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk, stir constantly and once boiling
                reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add half of the Gruyere cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and heat until the cheese is
                melted. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Spread about 1 teaspoon butter on 2 pieces of bread, 1 tablespoon cheese sauce on top and layer each with a ham slice. Spread 1 
                teaspoon butter on the remaining 2 pieces of bread, then spread
                Dijon mustard on top and sprinkle with remaining Gruyere. Transfer
                all 4 pieces to a baking sheet.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Broil in the pre-heated oven until cheese is almost melted, remove
                from oven, place the toast slices together to make 2 sandwiches
                and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich.
                Return to the broiler until sauce turns brown,about 2 minutes.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                While the sandwiches are broiling, heat remaining butter in a
                non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Crack 2 eggs into the
                skillet keeping them completely separate. Season with salt and
                pepper. Add water, cover and baste until whites are set but
                yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                Top each sandwich with an egg and sprinle with dill, if using.
                Serve immediately.
                Enjoy!
            </p></li>
